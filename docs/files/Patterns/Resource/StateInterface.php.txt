/**
 * Observer/Publisher State Interface
 * 
 * This was originally conceived for use in an 'event' system utilizing
 * publisher/observer design pattern for primus/falcraft.  This interface
 * could also apply to anything that has a changing state, such as a
 * finite state machine.
 * 
 * Following is the original documentation from primus/falcraft
 * 
 * This is the state interface to be used in the observer/publisher pattern.
 * Pretty straight forward, you set a state and get a state.  The state can be
 * any valid php value.

     * State Interface
     * 
     * This was originally conceived for use in an 'event' system utilizing
     * publisher/observer design pattern for primus/falcraft.  This interface
     * could also apply to anything that has a changing state, such as a
     * finite state machine.
     * 
     * Following is the original documentation from primus/falcraft
     * 
     * This is used to represent an acceptable state object for a publisher. 
     * Any object that implements this interface is ready to be used in the 
     * publisher/observer pattern implemented in phabstractic
     * 
     * The idea is that a publishing object (publisher) has some form of
     * state to it.  When that state changes significantly (in other words
     * when an observer might be interested) it triggers all its observers
     * passing itself with it's state.
     * 
     * CHANGELOG

     * 1.0: created StateInterface - August 16th, 2013
     * 2.0: recreated for inclusion in Primus - April 2nd, 2015
     * 3.0: reformatted for inclusion in phabstractic - July 26th, 2016
